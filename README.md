# YOLO Object Detection

This project is an **Object Detection system using YOLO** (You Only Look Once). It can detect multiple objects in images or real-time video streams with high accuracy and speed.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Real-time object detection
- Detects multiple object classes
- Works on images, videos, and webcam feed
- Lightweight and fast inference using YOLOv8 (or your YOLO version)
- Easy to train on custom datasets

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Trained on Custom dataset
- Dataset prepared in YOLO format images
- Supports custom classes for object detection

---

## 🖥️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 
- NumPy
- YOLO package (e.g., ultralytics for YOLOv8)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
